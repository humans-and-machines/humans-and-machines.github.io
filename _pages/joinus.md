<h4>MSE Applicants</h4>
<hr>

Princeton’s CS MSE program is highly competitive and offers full financial
support through Teaching Assistantships (see up-to-date information
[here](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/academics/degrees-requirements/fields-study/computer-science)).

The admission process is centralized at the department level, and decisions are
not made by individual faculty. However, if you’re hoping to do research with
me as part of your thesis requirement, you’re welcome to mention my name in
your statement; no need to email me.

If you are already in the program, shoot Manoel an email!

<br />

<h4>High School Students</h4>
<hr>

Unfortunately, we don’t currently have any positions for high school students.
If you email Manoel, please know that you will not receive a reply. This is not
a reflection of your abilities – we simply don’t have the capacity
to respond to the volume of requests.
